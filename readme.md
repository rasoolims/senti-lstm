## Requirement
You need to install [dynet](https://github.com/clab/dynet) library and its python wrapper. Look at its [installation guidelines](http://dynet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html). 

__Note:__ it is usually recommended to use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install python-based libraries.
